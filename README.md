# jacquerie
Similar to jQuery but without the burden of history

## Why

jQuery's *"Write Less, Do More"* is wonderful.

But it's old.

Now your browser is expected to have promises, CSS transitions, fetch, querySelectorAll, weak maps, arrow functions, etc.

Cross browser behavior is also very consistent.

Usages change too.

Most of jQuery's API and most of the implementation is now useless.

But a lot of jQuery's API is still relevant. And we don't need to learn it.

That's why jQuery simplified alternatives make a lot of sense. This is one. This is mine, it may not suit you.
